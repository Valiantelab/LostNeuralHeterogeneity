# LostNeuralHeterogeneity
Code associated with the publication, "Lost neural heterogeneity in human epilepsy is a fundamental principle unifying disease etiologies", currently in revision at PNAS.

Here, we provide code to generate the figures in the main text using computational/mathematical analysis (Figures 2-5). Code for supplementary figures is available upon request to the authors.

Figure 2: Code to run a single simulation with particular values of sigma_e and sigma_i and output the rheobase values, and plotting code specific to this figure.

Figure 3: Code to run a single simulation with particular values of sigma_e and sigma_i, and plotting code specific to this figure.

Figure 4: Code to generate plots for the average values of the Synchrony Measure and Firing Rates over multiple simulations (100 done in this figure), as well as code and plotting necessary for bifurcation analysis.

Figure 5: Code to generate plots. Fitting was performed using MATLAB tools as described in the Methods section of the paper.
