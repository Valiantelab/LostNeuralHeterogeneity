# LostNeuralHeterogeneity

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/386668057.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/386668057)

Code associated with the publication, "Resilience through diversity: Loss of neuronal heterogeneity in epileptogenic human tissue impairs network resilience to sudden changes in synchrony".

Here, we provide code to generate the figures in the main text. Code for supplementary figures is available upon request to the authors.

Figure 1: Ephys features presented in this figure are found in the 'Raw data-Ephys -Features.xlsx' file. Code used to obtain these features from experimental traces is found in the 'Scripts_Ephys Features' folder. Raw data is available upon request to the authors.

Figure 2: Code to run a single simulation with particular values of sigma_e and sigma_i and output the rheobase values, and plotting code specific to this figure.

Figure 3: Code to run a single simulation with particular values of sigma_e and sigma_i, and plotting code specific to this figure.

Figure 4: Code to generate plots for the average values of the Synchrony Measure and Firing Rates over multiple simulations (100 done in this figure), as well as code and plotting necessary for bifurcation analysis.

Figure 5: Code to generate plots. Fitting was performed using MATLAB tools as described in the Methods section of the paper.
