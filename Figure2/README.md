Compile and run Figure2_outputh.cpp with inputs of the desired sigma_e and sigma_i values. Number of trials can be changed on line 41 (#define Trials).

Matlab file HeteroDist.m will generate figures akin to panels c and d (if you change the number of trials, you may need to tinker with that parameter value and alter the file name towards the beginning of the code).

Matlab file SingleRunPlot_1000ms.m will generate figures akin to panels e and f. Set target=1 (this is an artifact from previous code).

Remaining Matlab files are various plotting functions that may or may not be used in these sets of code (they are the "library" I keep for all my Matlab plotting code, just in case).
