Compile and run Figure3_singleruns.cpp with inputs of the desired sigma_e and sigma_i values. Number of trials can be changed on line 41 (#define Trials).

Matlab file SingleRunPlot.m will generate figures of the kind displayed in Figure 3. Set target=1 (this is an artifact from previous code).

Remaining Matlab files are various plotting functions that may or may not be used in these sets of code (they are the "library" I keep for all my Matlab plotting code, just in case).
