Matlab file Figure5.m will generate the components of Figure 5. 

Note that the "fit" in panel a is already included in this file; details on how this fit was performed are found in the Methods of the paper.

Matlab file convolution.m is necessary to run this file.

Remaining Matlab files are various plotting functions that may or may not be used in these sets of code (they are the "library" I keep for all my Matlab plotting code, just in case).
